## ML - Task5 (Classification & Clustering)

<p>Use sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train your model using logistic regression. You need to figure out the accuracy of your model and use that to predict different samples in your test dataset. In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,</p>
<p>Sepal Length</p>
<p>Sepal Width</p>
<p>Petal length</p>
<p>Petal width</p>
  <br/>
<p>Using above 4 features you will classify a flower  in one of the three categories,</p>
  <br/>
<p>Setosa</p>
<p>Versicolour</p>
<p>Virginica</p>
<p>Download the iris dataset directly from sklearn.dataset</p>
<p>Use the same data for different clustering(exclude target variable) and classification algorithm</p>
